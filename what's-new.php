            <p>In Amy West's article, Digital Spy GB video discussed the plot details, several cues information, and everything needs to know by the audience. Specifically, in the show, Tommy will probably lose his mind because his mental states were unstable. In the season 5 final theme, Tommy Shelby with a gun on his head, screaming and dreaming his dead wife and the dead horse. Additionally, Tommy does not know who betrayed him? Who wants his position? Or even who wants his head? These questions are waiting to be answered in season 6. According to Digital Spy, GB interviewed director Anthony Byrne; if the audience pays close attention to the details in season 5, they will likely have answers. "we actually cut stuff around that end section to make it more oblique," said Anthony Byrne. The biggest suspects could be Michael and Gina, Gina seems to want to manipulate things behind the theme, and she collects massive money from the drug deal. Also, Michael has an opportunity to take over Shelby's empire.</p>
